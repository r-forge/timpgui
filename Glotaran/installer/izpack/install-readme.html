        <h1>Glotaran installation readme</h1>

        <h2>Features</h2>

        <p>Glotaran stands for Global and Target Analysis. It is designed to be a graphical front end for the R-package TIMP, providing an alternative for the script language used there. However, due to the immense extensibility of the platform on top of which Glotaran was built can potentially provide a lot more functionality than TIMP of the R platform itself would allow for. This functionality includes but it not limited to: <br></p>

            <li>Visual model building</li>
