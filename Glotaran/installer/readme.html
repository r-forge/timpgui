<h1>Glotaran: a graphical user interface for the R-package TIMP</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Glotaran stands for Global and Target Analysis. It is designed to be a graphical front end for the R-package TIMP, providing an alternative for the script language used there. However, due to the immense extensibility of the platform on top of which Glotaran was built can potentially provide a lot more functionality than TIMP of the R platform itself would allow for. This functionality includes but it not limited to: <br></p>

<ul>
    <li>Interactive data exploration and data selection</li>
    <li>Visual model building</li>
    <li>Interactive data analysis</li>
    <li>Easy extensibility for custom binary/proprietary data support.</li>
</ul>

<p>Glotaran consists of 2 parts: the core user interface, and the computational engine. The user interface was built using Java based technology and as a result it can potentially run on any operating system for which Java supported exists. The computational engine was built on top of the R-platform. R compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS. The core user interface and the computational engine communicate via a wrapper library over the standard TCP/IP protocal. This means the engine can run on either the local machine, or on a remote machine connected to the local machine via a network (not yet supported). Detailed system requirements can be found in the next section.<br></p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1+ GHz CPU</li>
    <li>1GB of RAM</li>
    <li>250MB of disk space</li>
    <li>Java Run Time Enviroment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Local machine only</h3>

<h4>Glotaran</h4>
<p>
    Included with this distribution is a so called jar file. In order to execute this file,
wether it be on Windows or Linux you need to have the Java (tm) Runtime Platform installed.
The latest version of the Java Run Time can be downloaded from the website of Sun Microsystems:<br>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>
<br></p>
<p>
To install Glotaran either double click the setup.jar file and select "Run using Java" or type: <br>
<b>java - jar setup.jar</b>
</p>

<h4>R</h4>
<p>This program also requires a working installation of R on your machine, with the R-Packages TIMP and Rserve installed.
If you don't have R and the packages TIMP and Rserve installed already, please do so before you proceed with the installation.
</p>


<h5>TIMP</h5>
<p>To install the R-package TIMP, please take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start R; either from the command line or start the RGui</li>
    <li>Execute the following command:</li>
    <li>install.packages("TIMP")</li>
</ul>

<h5>Rserve</h5>
<p>To install the R-package Rserve, please take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start R; either from the command line or start the RGui</li>
    <li>Execute the following command:</li>
    <li>install.packages("Rserve")</li>
</ul>

<h5>Start Rserve</h5>
Before you run the Glotaran program it is important that you do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Start R; either from the command line or start the RGui</li>
    <li>Execute the following commands:</li>
    <li>library(Rserve)</li>
    <li>Rserve() (for Windows and Linux/Unix) or Rserve(args="--no-save") (for Mac OS X)</li>
    <li>Start Glotaran from your application menu. Alternatively you can start Glotaran using the glotaran executable in the bin folder of the installation folder.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using a remote computational server</h3>
