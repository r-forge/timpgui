Post installation notes:

This is a beta version and, as a result contains some bugs. The most noteworthy are:

- The first time you start the program you get a notification about some modules missing. Simply press "Disable modules and continue".
- When you start the program, you will see a welcome page of the Netbeans platform, on top which this program has been built. Simple untick the checkbox "Show on startup".

If you find any bugs, or miss any features you would like to have implemented, simply contact one of the authors.
